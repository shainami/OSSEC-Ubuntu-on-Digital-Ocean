<ins>Synopsis:</ins>

This tutorial will briefly go over the installation of OSSEC within a Digital Ocean droplet.
Additionally, we will also install the OSSEC agent (via Windows) to report to this server. And as a last step we’ll also install a web user interface to look for alerts.

[1. Installing OSSEC on Ubuntu Server using DigitalOcean.](#1-lets-begin-the-installation-of-ossec-ubuntu-using-digitalocean)

[2. Setting up an OSSEC agent using Windows.](#2-next-setting-up-an-agent-and-connecting-to-the-server)


</br>


## 1. Let's begin the Installation of OSSEC Ubuntu using DigitalOcean:

<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5980deaee6f2e1738e18738c/1550165343634-2QDHAJHNQ82KZZ8KY91C/start-here-gif.gif" width=50% height=50%>

Update system sources

``` $ sudo apt update ```

<br/>
<br/>

Upgrade packages

**$ sudo apt upgrade -y**

<br/>
<br/>

Install the packages to build OSSEC from sources.

**$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc make unzip sendmail inotify-tools expect libevent-dev libpcre2-dev libz-dev libssl-dev -y**


<br/>
<br/>


Begin to download OSSEC.

**$ sudo wget -P /opt https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/3.6.0.tar.gz**


<br/>
<br/>


Extract them from the tar. Use the following command:

**$ sudo tar -zxf /opt/3.6.0.tar.gz --directory /opt**

<br/>
<br/>


Once downloaded start the installation.

**$ sudo sh /opt/ossec-hids-3.6.0/install.sh**

<br/>
<br/>


The first questions is what language would you like to install OSSEC in on your system.

**$ sudo sh /opt/ossec-hids-3.6.0/install.sh**

<br/>
<br/>



(en/br/cn/de/el/es/fr/hu/it/jp/nl/pl/ru/sr/tr?) [en]:

I’ll choose the default. (Select differently if you want another language.)

Than **PRESS ENTER.**

<br/>
<br/>



Next install the OSSEC script.

OSSEC HIDS v3.6.0 Installation Script - http://www.ossec.net


You are about to start the installation process of the OSSEC HIDS.

You must have a C compiler pre-installed in your system.


- System: Linux ossecman 4.15.0-88-generic

- User: root

- Host: ossecman

**-- Press ENTER to continue or Ctrl-C to abort. --**


<br/>
<br/>



Answer the following questions:

1- What kind of installation do you want (server, agent, local, hybrid or help)?

Type **server**.

<br/>
<br/>


You'll see.

- Server installation chosen.


Choose where to install OSSEC.

2- Setting up the installation environment.


- Choose where to install the OSSEC HIDS [/var/ossec]:

**Use the default by pressing enter**

<br/>
<br/>



Proceed to configure OSSEC.

3- Configuring the OSSEC HIDS.


3.1- Do you want e-mail notification? (y/n) [y]:

Type **Yes**

<br/>
<br/>



- What's your e-mail address?

Type the **your email** or use **root@localhost**

<br/>
<br/>



3.1- Do you want e-mail notification? (y/n) [y]:

<br/>

Type **Y**

<br/>
<br/>

- What's your e-mail address? root@localhost or your email address.


- We found your SMTP server as: 127.0.0.1 or IP Address of server


- Do you want to use it? (y/n) [y]:

<br/>

Type **Y**

<br/>
<br/>

Note: This option alerts will be root’s mail account. And they will read similar to this following format.



3.2- Do you want to run the integrity check daemon? (y/n) [y]:

<br/>

Type **Y**


<br/>
<br/>


Time to ask if a rootkit check daemon is of your interest. Why not?


<br/>

Type **Y**


<br/>
<br/>


3.3- Do you want to run the rootkit detection engine? (y/n) [y]:

<br/>

**Y**


<br/>
<br/>


3.4- Active response allows you to execute a specific

command based on the events received. For example,

you can block an IP address or disable access for

a specific user.

More information at:

http://www.ossec.net/en/manual.html#active-response

- Do you want to enable active response? (y/n) [y]:

If you want strongest security than choose:


<br/>

Type **Y**

<br/>
<br/>


Now we’ll be aksed an interesting question.

- By default, we can enable the host-deny and the

firewall-drop responses. The first one will add

a host to the /etc/hosts.deny and the second one

will block the host on iptables (if linux) or on

ipfilter (if Solaris, FreeBSD or NetBSD).

- They can be used to stop SSHD brute force scans,

portscans and some other forms of attacks. You can

also add them to block on snort events, for example.

- Do you want to enable the firewall-drop response? (y/n) [y]:

<br/>

Choose **Y**


<br/>
<br/>



If you choose yes you’ll see something like this.


- firewall-drop enabled (local) for levels >= 6

- (_note_an_ip_address_should_appear_here)


Go to next question.


Now, this question will be asked.

Do you want to add more IPs to the white list? (y/n)? [n]:

**Press Enter**

<br/>
<br/>


Next, is enabling system log remotely.


3.5- Do you want to enable remote syslog (port 514 udp)? (y/n) [y]:

**Press Enter**

<br/>
<br/>



Now after all the questions you should see something similar to this message.


3.6- Setting the configuration to analyze the following logs:

-- /var/log/auth.log

-- /var/log/syslog

-- /var/log/dpkg.log


**--- Press ENTER to continue ---**

<br/>
<br/>



The last message from the build will read very similar to this.

- System is Debian (Ubuntu or derivative).

- Init script modified to start OSSEC HIDS during boot.

- Configuration finished properly.

- To start OSSEC HIDS:

/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

- To stop OSSEC HIDS:

/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop

- The configuration can be viewed or modified at /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

Thanks for using the OSSEC HIDS.

# 2. Next, setting up an agent and connecting to the server.

Run the 'manage_agents' to add or remove them:

/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents

Once OSSEC has been finally installed we need to make systemd aware of it so can can monitor processes related to it with sytem-based tools.

**$ sudo systemctl enable ossec**

OSSEC is open-sourced software, that has Host-based Intrusion Detection System or HIDS. The HID system features log analysis, windows registry monitoring, regulated integrity checks, time-based alerts, active response and rootkit detection. Altogether, this application is useful if you want observe all things taking place on your server and have it logged and reported to you.


**What does the program do?

OSSEC encorporates itself onto your server and serves as a detection system against intruders or unauthorized/suspicious access.


**What problem does the application solve?**

OSSEC aims to solve issues of intrusion on systems that will otherwise go unnoticed if you have no system logging or lack the capacity to protect your server from any unwanted access.

**Use cases**
Give 3 use case for the software.

<ins>Examples:</ins>

1 – Someone tries to use a rootkit
2 – Someone tries to access your server without authorization
3 – Someone has incorrect access key user agent
